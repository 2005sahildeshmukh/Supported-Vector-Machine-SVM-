# Supported Vector Machine SVM
This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between them.

In this project, SVM is applied to the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to predict whether a patient has diabetes (binary classification). The project covers:

Data preprocessing and feature scaling

Training SVM models with kernel.

Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of decision boundaries and insights

This project serves as a practical example of how SVM can be used for real-world classification problems.
